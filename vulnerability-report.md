# Vulnerability Report

## SQL Injection

SQL Injection allows an attacker or hacker to input special characters into a SQL statement in order to gain access to data.  If the input is not sanitized, the intruder could potentially login and access data as if they were an administrator which would allow them to manipulate private information. 

Our site utilizes authorization tags so that only authorized users have access to specific parts of the site.  For example, 
```[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]``` only allows administrators to access the product inventory.

## Weak Account Management

Weak Account Management is a vulnerability because it leaves room for un-authorized users to gain information user accounts.

We combat this by making sure not to confirm or deny user names or passwords.  A user will receive an "invalid login" message upon the input of an incorrect user name or password.  However, the existence of a user is never confirmed in order to protect the account.

Ex: ```ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, "Invalid Login");```
