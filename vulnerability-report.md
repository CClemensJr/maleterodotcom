# Vulnerability Report

## SQL Injection

SQL Injection allows an attacker or hacker to input special characters into a SQL statement in order to gain access to data.  If the input is not sanitized, the intruder could potentially login and access data as if they were an administrator which would allow them to manipulate private information. 

Our site utilizes authorization tags so that only authorized users have access to specific parts of the site.  For example, 
```[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]``` only allows administrators to access the product inventory.

## Weak Account Management

Weak Account Management is a vulnerability because it leaves room for un-authorized users to gain information user accounts.

We combat this by making sure not to confirm or deny user names or passwords.  A user will receive an "invalid login" message upon the input of an incorrect user name or password.  However, the existence of a user is never confirmed in order to protect the account.

Ex: ```ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, "Invalid Login");```

## Missing Function Level Access Control

Missing function level access control refers to the users ability to access functions of the website without having the appropriate access.

We combat by using the Authorize data annotation to ensure sensitive parts of the site redirect user's to the login page if they are not logged in or do not have enough access.

Ex: ```[Authorize]
       public class UserController
    ```

## Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive data exposure refers to the passwords and means used to access a website. An insecure website will tend to use SSL or save encrypted passwords that have not been hashed

We combat this by taking advantage of Microsoft's Identity framework. The Identity api hashes the passwords for us and stores them in a separate database that we cannot access.

Ex: ```
      using Maletero.Models.ViewModels;
      using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
      public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser {}
    ```
